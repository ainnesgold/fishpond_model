# fishpond_model

Here is the code for modeling fishpond restoration in K Bay. Each script runs independently and tests a different combination of factors surrounding restoration, indicated in the filename and at the start of each script. Some of them take a while to run, since they test different combinations of variables.

area_bayfishing_Sadult tests loko ia area, bay fishing effort, and adult fish site fidelity.
area_bayfishing_Srecruit tests loko ia area, bay fishing effort, and recruit fish site fidelity.
area_lokoiafishing_Sadult tests loko ia area, lokoia fishing effort, and adult fish site fidelity.
area_bayfishing_Srecruit tests loko ia area, lokoia fishing effort, and recruit fish site fidelity.
fishmort_sens tests loko ia fish mortality (variable g in the code)
Rm_Vm_sens tests max fish ingestion rate (Rm) and max phyto growth rate (Vm)
ks_sens tests half sat constant (ks)
